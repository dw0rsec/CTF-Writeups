Since ports 139 and 445 are open i used smbclient to enumerate smb and found a file called `enter.txt` in the `websvr` share in which i found some credentials for Subrion: `admin:7sKvntXdPEJaxazce9PXi24zaFrLiKWCk` and the hint that there is a `/subrion` directory on the webserver. I failed on cracking the password after a while i remembered a "magic recipe" mentioned so i throw the pw hash into cyberchef and i get the password `S*******` back.

```shell
smbclient -N -L 10.10.19.22

smbclient //10.10.19.22/websvr -U ''
```

On port 80 i found a webserver, which just presented me the default apache page so i started a directory bruteforce with `gobuster`. This gives me 2 directories `/test` and `/wordpress`. On `/test` i just found a site showing a sh*tload of uncloseable popups and nothing else. 

```shell
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.19.22/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -t 30 -o gobuster_scan.
```

I have done also a `gobuster` scan on `/subrion` but had some issues with it. After a little bit research i found a `robots.txt` on `/subrion` which contains some useful stuff.

## üí• Exploitation:

On `http://10.10.19.22/subrion/panel` i found a login form si i logged in with the creds from the smb share. Since im on a `Subrion CMS 4.2.1` i used `searchsploit` to look for exploits for this version. I found a authenticated file upload exploit which i tried. This gives me a shell as `www-data` but i could not change the cwd so i uploaded a reverse shell and started a `netcat` listener.

```shell
searchsploit subrion 4.2.1

searchsploit -m php/webapps/49876.py

python3 49876.py -u http://10.10.19.22/subrion/panel/ -l admin -p S*******
```

## üîì Priviledge Escalation:

Since there was a wordpress running on the server i used `find` to locate the `wp-config.php` which gives me the password `ImA***************`. I looked for other users in `/etc/passwd` and found the user `scamsite`. I tried to ssh in to the box as `scamsite` and the db password found in the `wp-config.php` and was succesful. `sudo -l` gives me `(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/iconv` so i looked it up on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/iconv/). I was able to read the `root.txt` abusing `iconv`.

```shell
LFILE=/root/root.txt

sudo /usr/bin/iconv -f 8859_1 -t 8859_1 "$LFILE"
```

## üí∞ Loot:

```shell
# root.txt
